export const mockReview = `The submitted repository demonstrates a clear intention to build a functional and understandable application, but there are several areas that could be significantly improved. The project shows potential, yet suffers from inconsistency in structure, naming conventions, and overall maintainability.

Strengths

The idea of the project is relevant and useful for beginners to intermediate developers.

Basic setup with package management and build tooling is correctly configured.

Some code comments are present, which makes the logic slightly easier to follow.

Weaknesses & Issues

File organization is inconsistent: some components are stored in src/components, others are directly in src. This makes it harder to navigate.

Variable naming is unclear in several places (e.g., using data1, tempVar), which hurts readability.

Error handling is minimal; most asynchronous operations assume success and do not cover rejected promises.

Several functions exceed 50 lines of code and perform multiple responsibilities. This increases the cognitive load for anyone reading or maintaining the code.

Recommendations

Refactor components into smaller, more focused pieces. A good rule is that if a function or component does more than one clear task, it should probably be split.

Improve naming conventions. Use descriptive names that reflect intent, not just implementation detail. For example, instead of doThing(), use calculateUserScore().

Apply consistent code formatting. Adopt tools like ESLint and Prettier with a shared configuration to enforce a clean style.

Add more tests. Current test coverage is close to zero. Without automated testing, regressions are likely as the project grows.

Handle edge cases. For instance, what happens if the API request fails? What if the input is empty? Those cases should display meaningful error messages to the user.

Potential Improvements

Add documentation in a README.md that clearly explains how to set up and run the project, as well as its purpose.

Consider adding type safety (e.g., TypeScript or JSDoc) to reduce runtime errors.

Make use of environment variables for API keys instead of hardcoding them in the code.

Provide a demo or deployment link so reviewers can try the application without setting it up locally.

Conclusion
Overall, the project works at a very basic level but lacks polish. With proper restructuring, attention to best practices, and stronger error handling, it could become a much more professional and maintainable codebase. For now, it demonstrates effort and learning progress, but it should not be considered production-ready.`;
